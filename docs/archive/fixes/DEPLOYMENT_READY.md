## üéØ Deployment Instructions

### Upload to Hostinger
1. Login to Hostinger File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html` directory
3. Delete existing files (backup first!)
4. Upload **contents** of `dist/` folder (not the folder itself)
5. Ensure `index.html` is at root level
6. Create `.htaccess` file (see deployment guide)

### Post-Deployment Steps
1. Verify site loads with HTTPS
2. Test login functionality
3. Clear cache for existing users (if needed)
4. Test user approval flow
5. Verify all pages load correctly

## üîß Critical Fix Details

### User Approval Cache Bug (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- Approved users received "pending approval" error on login
- Cache not cleared when Super User clicked "Approve"

**Solution:**
- Added cache clearing in `enableUser()` function
- Now clears both `systemUsers` AND individual `userProfile_${userId}` caches
- Location: `src/services/userManagementService.ts` lines 1150-1152

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Also clear individual user profile cache to force fresh load on next login
localStorage.removeItem(`userProfile_${userId}`)
console.log(`üßπ Cleared cached user profile for userId: ${userId}`)
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Future approvals automatically clear all caches
- ‚úÖ Approved users can login immediately
- ‚úÖ No manual cache clearing needed

---

## üìã For Existing Users

Users who were approved **before** this deployment need to clear their cache once:

**Option 1: Browser Console**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('userProfile_249b8d7d-9371-48aa-9527-acff8f979a56')
localStorage.removeItem('systemUsers')
```

**Option 2: Full Clear**
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```

Then refresh and login again.
