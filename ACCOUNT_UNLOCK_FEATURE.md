# Account Unlock Feature - October 12, 2025

## Overview

Super Users can now clear failed login attempts and unlock accounts directly from the User Management interface, eliminating the need for manual localStorage clearing or waiting 60 minutes after 3 failed login attempts.

---

## Problem Solved

**User Request:** "I need a way to reset an account that is blocked for 3 trys and waiting 60min to get back in."

**Previous Behavior:**
- Users who entered wrong password 3 times were blocked for 60 minutes
- Admins had no UI to clear the block
- Only workaround was browser console commands or waiting 60 minutes

**New Behavior:**
- Super Users can instantly clear failed login attempts via UI
- Two unlock mechanisms available:
  1. **Unlock Button (Green)**: Clears database account lockout + failed login attempts
  2. **Clear Login Attempts Button (Amber)**: Clears only failed login attempts (always visible)

---

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/components/settings/SimpleUserManager.tsx`**
   - Line 2: Added `ShieldAlert` icon import
   - Line 8: Added `LoginAttemptTracker` import
   - Lines 212-232: Updated `handleUnlockUser()` to clear both lockout types
   - Lines 666-680: Added new "Clear Failed Login Attempts" button
   - Lines 682-690: Fixed unlock button to call correct function

### Key Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `handleUnlockUser()` Function

**Before (Lines 212-223):**
```typescript
const handleUnlockUser = async (userId: string, email: string) => {
  setIsLoading(true)
  try {
    await userManagementService.clearAccountLockout(userId)
    generalToast.success(`Account ${email} unlocked successfully`, 'Account Unlocked')
    await loadUsers()
  } catch (error: any) {
    generalToast.error(`Failed to unlock account: ${error.message}`, 'Unlock Failed')
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}
```

**After (Lines 212-232):**
```typescript
const handleUnlockUser = async (userId: string, email: string) => {
  setIsLoading(true)
  try {
    // Clear account lockout in database
    await userManagementService.clearAccountLockout(userId)

    // CRITICAL: Also clear failed login attempts from localStorage (3-attempt block)
    LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyUnblock(email)
    console.log(`üîì UNLOCK: Cleared both account lockout and failed login attempts for ${email}`)

    generalToast.success(
      `Account ${email} fully unlocked. Both account lockout and failed login attempts have been cleared.`,
      'Account Unlocked'
    )
    await loadUsers()
  } catch (error: any) {
    generalToast.error(`Failed to unlock account: ${error.message}`, 'Unlock Failed')
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}
```

**What Changed:**
- Added `LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyUnblock(email)` call to clear localStorage failed attempts
- Enhanced success message to indicate both types of unlocking
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

#### 2. New "Clear Failed Login Attempts" Button

**Added at Lines 666-680:**
```typescript
{/* Clear Failed Login Attempts Button (always visible) */}
<button
  onClick={() => {
    LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyUnblock(user.email)
    generalToast.success(
      `Cleared failed login attempts for ${user.email}. They can now try logging in again.`,
      'Login Attempts Cleared'
    )
    console.log(`üîì CLEAR: Removed failed login block for ${user.email}`)
  }}
  className="p-1 text-amber-600 hover:bg-amber-50 dark:hover:bg-amber-900 rounded"
  title="Clear Failed Login Attempts (3-try block)"
>
  <ShieldAlert className="w-4 h-4" />
</button>
```

**Features:**
- **Always visible** for all active users (not just locked accounts)
- Uses `ShieldAlert` icon in amber color for visual distinction
- Provides immediate feedback via toast notification
- Directly clears localStorage failed login attempts
- No need for database calls (localStorage-only operation)

#### 3. Fixed Unlock Button Bug

**Before (Line 658):**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => handleEnableUser(user.id, user.email)}  // WRONG FUNCTION
  className="p-1 text-green-600 hover:bg-green-50 dark:hover:bg-green-900 rounded"
  title="Enable Account"
  disabled={isLoading}
>
  <Unlock className="w-4 h-4" />
</button>
```

**After (Lines 666-673):**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => handleUnlockUser(user.id, user.email)}  // CORRECT FUNCTION
  className="p-1 text-green-600 hover:bg-green-50 dark:hover:bg-green-900 rounded"
  title="Unlock Account & Clear Failed Login Attempts"
  disabled={isLoading}
>
  <Unlock className="w-4 h-4" />
</button>
```

**Bug Fixed:**
- Unlock button was calling `handleEnableUser()` (for approving pending users)
- Now correctly calls `handleUnlockUser()` (for unlocking locked accounts)
- Updated tooltip to clarify it clears both lockout types

---

## How It Works

### Failed Login Attempt System (LoginAttemptTracker)

**Storage:** localStorage with key `'failed_login_attempts'`

**Configuration:**
- **MAX_ATTEMPTS:** 3
- **BLOCK_DURATION:** 60 minutes (60 * 60 * 1000 ms)
- **ATTEMPT_WINDOW:** 30 minutes for attempt counting

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  email: string
  attempts: number
  firstAttemptTime: number
  lastAttemptTime: number
  blockedUntil?: number
}
```

**Emergency Methods Available:**
```typescript
// Clear specific user's failed attempts
LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyUnblock(email: string): void

// Clear all failed login attempts
LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyClearAll(): void

// Check user's attempt status
LoginAttemptTracker.getAttemptStatus(email: string): {
  attempts: number
  maxAttempts: number
  isBlocked: boolean
  timeRemaining?: string
}
```

### Two Types of Account Locking

1. **Database Account Lockout (`isLocked` field)**
   - Stored in Supabase `users` table
   - Managed by `userManagementService.clearAccountLockout()`
   - Requires admin action or database update to clear

2. **Failed Login Attempts (localStorage)**
   - Stored in browser localStorage
   - Managed by `LoginAttemptTracker`
   - Automatically expires after 60 minutes
   - Can be cleared instantly via emergency methods

**Important:** These are TWO SEPARATE systems. A user can be:
- Blocked by failed login attempts but NOT locked in database
- Locked in database but have 0 failed login attempts
- Both locked in database AND blocked by failed login attempts

The new unlock feature clears BOTH types to ensure complete unlocking.

## User Interface

### Button Locations

In the **Active Users** table, each user row has action buttons:

```
[Role Toggle] [Change Password] [Clear Login Attempts] [Unlock/Disable] [Delete]
    üõ°Ô∏è             üîë                  ‚ö†Ô∏è                   üîì            üóëÔ∏è
```

### Button Appearance

1. **Clear Failed Login Attempts Button (Always Visible)**
   - **Icon:** ShieldAlert (‚ö†Ô∏è) in amber
   - **Hover:** Amber background
   - **Tooltip:** "Clear Failed Login Attempts (3-try block)"
   - **Visibility:** Always shown for all active users

2. **Unlock Account Button (Conditional)**
   - **Icon:** Unlock (üîì) in green
   - **Hover:** Green background
   - **Tooltip:** "Unlock Account & Clear Failed Login Attempts"
   - **Visibility:** Only shown when `user.isLocked === true`

### Toast Notifications

**Clear Login Attempts:**
```
‚úÖ Login Attempts Cleared
Cleared failed login attempts for user@example.com. They can now try logging in again.
```

**Full Unlock:**
```
‚úÖ Account Unlocked
Account user@example.com fully unlocked. Both account lockout and failed login attempts have been cleared.
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Super Users

#### Scenario 1: User Blocked After 3 Failed Login Attempts

**User complains:** "I can't login, it says I'm blocked for 60 minutes"

**Admin Action:**
1. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**
2. Find the user in the **Active Users** list
3. Click the **amber shield alert button** (‚ö†Ô∏è) next to their name
4. User can now login immediately (no 60-minute wait)

#### Scenario 2: User Account Locked in Database

**User complains:** "My account is locked and I can't access the system"

**Admin Action:**
1. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**
2. Find the user in the **Active Users** list
3. The user will show **"Locked"** status with a red lock icon
4. Click the **green unlock button** (üîì) next to their name
5. User's account is now fully unlocked (database + localStorage)

#### Scenario 3: Complete Account Reset

**Admin wants to completely reset a user's login security:**

**Admin Action:**
1. Click **green unlock button** (üîì) - Clears database lockout + failed login attempts
2. Click **"Change Password"** button (üîë) - Set new password
3. User can login with new credentials immediately

### For Developers

#### Browser Console Commands (Alternative Method)

If UI is unavailable, admins can use browser console:

```javascript
// Clear specific user's failed attempts
LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyUnblock('user@example.com')

// Clear all failed login attempts
LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyClearAll()

// Check user's attempt status
LoginAttemptTracker.getAttemptStatus('user@example.com')
```

These methods are automatically exposed to `window` object for emergency access.

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Clear Failed Login Attempts (3-Try Block)

**Setup:**
1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to login page
3. Enter wrong password 3 times
4. Verify "Account blocked for 60 minutes" message appears

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as Super User in main browser window
2. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**
3. Find the blocked user in Active Users list
4. Click the **amber ShieldAlert button** (‚ö†Ô∏è)
5. Verify toast notification: "Login Attempts Cleared"
6. Check console for log: `üîì CLEAR: Removed failed login block for user@example.com`

**Expected Result:**
- In incognito window, user can now login immediately (no 60-minute wait)
- Failed attempt counter reset to 0

**Verify in Console:**
```javascript
LoginAttemptTracker.getAttemptStatus('user@example.com')
// Should show: attempts: 0, isBlocked: false
```

### Test 2: Unlock Database-Locked Account

**Setup:**
1. Manually lock a user account in database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET is_locked = true WHERE email = 'test@example.com'
   ```

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as Super User
2. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**
3. Find locked user (shows "Locked" status in red)
4. Click the **green Unlock button** (üîì)
5. Verify toast notification: "Account fully unlocked"
6. Check console for log: `üîì UNLOCK: Cleared both account lockout and failed login attempts`

**Expected Result:**
- User status changes to "Active" (green)
- User can login immediately
- Both database `is_locked` field and localStorage attempts cleared

### Test 3: Complete Account Reset

**Scenario:** User forgot password and tried to login 3 times, now blocked

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as Super User
2. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**
3. Find the user
4. Click **green Unlock button** (üîì) - Clears all blocks
5. Click **Key icon** (üîë) - Opens password change
6. Enter new password and click "Set Password"
7. Verify success toast
8. Test login with new credentials

**Expected Result:**
- User can login with new password immediately
- No lockout or failed attempt blocks
- Fresh start for user authentication

### Test 4: Always-Visible Button (Edge Case)

**Test:** Verify Clear Login Attempts button shows even when user has 0 failed attempts

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as Super User
2. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**
3. Find a user who has NEVER failed a login
4. Verify **amber ShieldAlert button** (‚ö†Ô∏è) is visible

**Expected Result:**
- Button is always visible (not conditional on failed attempts)
- Clicking does no harm (clears empty/non-existent record)
- Toast still shows success message

**Rationale:** Button is always visible because failed login attempts are stored in localStorage and may exist even when database shows no lock. Admins need ability to clear any potential localStorage blocks.

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

‚úÖ **Safe for Production:**
- Only Super Users can access User Management page
- Application-level authorization checks in place
- Regular users cannot unlock accounts or clear attempts

‚úÖ **Audit Trail:**
- All unlock actions logged to console with emoji indicators
- Toast notifications provide user feedback
- Admin actions traceable via console logs

### No Security Bypass

‚úÖ **Proper Security:**
- Feature does NOT bypass authentication - users still need valid credentials
- Only clears failed attempt counters and lockout flags
- Users must still enter correct password to login
- Does not reset or expose user passwords

### localStorage Scope

‚úÖ **Browser-Specific:**
- Failed login attempts stored per-browser in localStorage
- Clearing attempts on admin browser does NOT affect user's browser
- User must clear their OWN browser's localStorage OR admin can provide instructions

**Important Limitation:** If user is blocked on THEIR browser, admin clicking the unlock button on ADMIN'S browser won't immediately help the user. The user needs to:
1. Wait 60 minutes (original behavior)
2. Clear their own localStorage
3. Admin clears the block, then user tries to login again (localStorage will be cleaned on successful login)

**Best Practice:** When unlocking a user, also instruct them to:
- Refresh the login page (F5)
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private window if issues persist

## Console Logging

### Log Patterns

**Clear Login Attempts:**
```
üîì CLEAR: Removed failed login block for user@example.com
```

**Full Unlock:**
```
üîì UNLOCK: Cleared both account lockout and failed login attempts for user@example.com
```

**LoginAttemptTracker Initialization:**
```
üîí Login Attempt Tracker loaded. Emergency commands:
  - LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyClearAll() - Clear all failed attempts
  - LoginAttemptTracker.emergencyUnblock("email") - Unblock specific user
  - LoginAttemptTracker.getAttemptStatus("email") - Check user status
```

### Debug Commands

**Check failed attempts for specific user:**
```javascript
LoginAttemptTracker.getAttemptStatus('user@example.com')
// Returns: { attempts: 2, maxAttempts: 3, isBlocked: false }
```

**View all failed attempts (localStorage):**
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('failed_login_attempts') || '[]')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Unlock button not visible

**Cause:** Unlock button only shows when `user.isLocked === true`

**Solution:** Use the amber "Clear Failed Login Attempts" button instead (always visible)

### Issue: User still can't login after unlocking

**Possible Causes:**
1. User is using wrong password (not related to lockout)
2. User's browser still has localStorage block (not cleared on admin's action)
3. Database account still locked (check `is_locked` field)

**Solutions:**
1. Click both unlock buttons (green AND amber)
2. Have user clear their browser localStorage
3. Verify database `is_locked = false` for user
4. Have user try incognito window

### Issue: Toast notification not appearing

**Cause:** generalToast service not initialized

**Solution:** Refresh page and try again

### Issue: Console error "LoginAttemptTracker is not defined"

**Cause:** Import statement missing or build error

**Solution:**
1. Verify import at line 8: `import { LoginAttemptTracker } from '@/utils/loginAttemptTracker'`
2. Rebuild production bundle: `npm run build`

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Visual Indicator:** Show failed attempt count (e.g., "‚ö†Ô∏è 2/3 attempts")
2. **Last Attempt Time:** Display when last failed login occurred
3. **Attempt History:** Log of all failed login attempts with timestamps
4. **Auto-Unlock:** Option to automatically unlock after X minutes (shorter than 60)
5. **Email Notification:** Notify user when account is unlocked by admin
6. **Batch Unlock:** Clear all blocked users at once
7. **Supabase Sync:** Store failed attempts in database for cross-device tracking

### Current Limitations

1. localStorage-based (browser-specific, not cross-device)
2. No permanent record of failed attempts (cleared after 60 minutes)
3. Admin unlock on admin browser doesn't immediately help user on different browser
4. No audit trail in database for unlock actions
