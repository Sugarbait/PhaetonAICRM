## üìÑ .htaccess File Content:

If you need to create the file manually in Hostinger File Manager:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /

  # Redirect all requests to index.html for SPA routing
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>

# Enable CORS for API requests
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization"
</IfModule>

# Compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/json
</IfModule>

# Browser Caching
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType image/svg+xml "access plus 1 year"
  ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 month"
  ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 month"
  ExpiresByType application/x-javascript "access plus 1 month"
  ExpiresByType text/javascript "access plus 1 month"
</IfModule>
```

## üß™ Test the Fix:

### Step 2: Clear Cache and Test

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

2. **Test Navigation**
   - Go to: https://phaetonai.nexasync.ca/
   - Login to your account
   - Click Dashboard - should load without 404! ‚úÖ

3. **Test Direct URL**
   - Go directly to: https://phaetonai.nexasync.ca/dashboard
   - Should load correctly without 404 ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ What This Fixes:

**Before:**
- ‚ùå 404 errors on `/dashboard`, `/settings`, `/calls`, `/sms`
- ‚ùå Refresh breaks the app
- ‚ùå Direct URL links don't work

**After:**
- ‚úÖ All routes work correctly
- ‚úÖ Refresh maintains current page
- ‚úÖ Direct URLs load properly
- ‚úÖ Bookmarks work
- ‚úÖ Share links work

---

## üîç How It Works:

**The .htaccess file tells Apache:**
1. Check if requested file exists (like `dashboard.html`)
2. If NOT found, redirect to `index.html`
3. React Router handles the `/dashboard` route
4. App loads correctly!

**This is required for ALL Single Page Applications (SPAs)**

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting:

### Issue: Still getting 404 after upload

**Solution 1: Check file name**
- File MUST be named `.htaccess` (starts with a dot)
- NO file extension (not `.htaccess.txt`)
- Check in File Manager: "Show Hidden Files" enabled

**Solution 2: Check file location**
- File MUST be in the same directory as `index.html`
- Usually `public_html` or root directory

**Solution 3: Check Apache mod_rewrite**
- Contact Hostinger support
- Ask: "Is mod_rewrite enabled for my account?"
- Most Hostinger plans have this enabled by default

### Issue: 500 Internal Server Error

**Solution:**
- Syntax error in .htaccess
- Copy the content exactly as shown above
- Check for extra spaces or characters

### Issue: Page loads but routing still broken

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Check console for JavaScript errors
