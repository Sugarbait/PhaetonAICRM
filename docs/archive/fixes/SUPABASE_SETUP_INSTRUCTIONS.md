# Supabase Setup Instructions for CareXPS CRM

## Current Status

✅ **Connection Working**: Your Supabase connection is properly configured
✅ **Environment Variables**: All required environment variables are present
✅ **Realtime**: Real-time subscriptions are working
✅ **Code Fixed**: Audit logger and notes service have been fixed

❌ **Missing Tables**: Several tables need to be created in your Supabase database

## Required Action: Create Missing Tables

Your Supabase project is missing several critical tables that the application expects. You need to run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Log into your project: `cpkslvmydfdevdftieck`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Run the Setup Script**
   - Copy the entire contents of `create-missing-tables.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

### What This Script Creates:

| Table | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `audit_logs` | HIPAA-compliant audit logging | ❌ Missing |
| `notes` | Call and SMS notes with sync | ⚠️ Wrong schema |
| `calls` | Call records and transcripts | ❌ Missing |
| `sms_messages` | SMS conversations | ❌ Missing |
| `patients` | Patient information (encrypted) | ❌ Missing |
| `user_settings` | User preferences and settings | ⚠️ Needs update |

## Application Features After Setup

Once the tables are created, your application will have:

### ✅ Cross-Device Sync
- Notes sync automatically across all devices
- Settings sync between desktop and mobile
- Real-time updates when data changes

### ✅ HIPAA Compliance
- All user actions are logged to audit_logs
- PHI data is properly encrypted
- Secure row-level security policies

### ✅ Rich Notes System
- Add notes to calls and SMS conversations
- Rich text formatting support
- Edit history tracking
- User attribution

## Testing After Setup

After running the SQL script, test the functionality:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   (Currently running on http://localhost:3019)

2. **Test Notes**:
   - Go to any call or SMS page
   - Add a note
   - Check browser console for "✅ HIPAA audit entry stored successfully"

3. **Test Cross-Device Sync**:
   - Open the app in two browser tabs
   - Add a note in one tab
   - Should appear in the other tab within seconds

## Troubleshooting

### If you see 404 errors:
- Make sure you've run the SQL script in Supabase
- Check the browser console for specific error messages
- Verify the table names match exactly

### If notes don't sync:
- Check the browser console for connection errors
- Verify your Supabase URL and API keys are correct
- Ensure RLS policies are properly set (done by the script)

### If audit logs aren't working:
- Check that the audit_logs table was created
- Verify the RLS policies allow inserts
- Look for console messages about fallback to localStorage

## Current Configuration

Your environment is properly configured with:

- **Supabase URL**: `https://cpkslvmydfdevdftieck.supabase.co`
- **API Key**: Properly configured (anon key)
- **Service Role Key**: Available for admin operations
- **HIPAA Mode**: Enabled
- **Encryption Keys**: Configured

## Security Notes

The setup script creates secure RLS policies that ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Audit logs are properly protected
- PHI data follows HIPAA guidelines
- Cross-device sync works securely

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL script** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Test the application** at http://localhost:3019
3. **Verify cross-device sync** by opening multiple browser tabs
4. **Check audit logging** in the browser console

After setup, your CareXPS CRM will have full cross-device synchronization with HIPAA-compliant audit logging!
