# Email Notification System - Retell AI Monitoring Fix

## Problem

Email notifications were not being sent for real-world calls/SMS records even though test emails worked and email configuration was correct (`elitesquadp@protonmail.com`).

## Root Cause

1. **Toast notification service** monitors Supabase `calls` and `sms_messages` tables
2. **Retell AI data** stays in Retell AI's cloud - NOT synced to Supabase
3. **No realtime events** trigger when calls/SMS come in through Retell AI
4. **Email notifications** only triggered by Supabase INSERT events
5. **Result**: No emails sent for real-world Retell AI records

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Retell AI Monitoring Service
**File**: `src/services/retellMonitoringService.ts`

**Features**:
- Polls Retell AI every 2 minutes for new records
- Checks both calls and chats/SMS
- Tracks seen IDs to prevent duplicate emails
- Sends email notifications for new records
- Memory-efficient (keeps only last 500 IDs)

**How it works**:
```typescript
// Polls Retell AI every 2 minutes
const POLL_INTERVAL = 2 * 60 * 1000

// On each check:
1. Get calls from last 2 minutes
2. Filter out already-seen call IDs
3. Send email for NEW calls
4. Get chats from last 2 minutes
5. Filter out already-seen chat IDs
6. Send email for NEW chats
```

### 2. Integrated with App.tsx
**File**: `src/App.tsx` (lines 423-426, 438)

**Changes**:
- Starts monitoring service when app initializes
- Stops monitoring service when app unmounts
- Runs alongside existing Retell service

### 3. Fixed Email Timezone
**File**: `src/services/emailNotificationService.ts` (line 455)

**Before**:
```typescript
${data.timestamp.toLocaleString()}
```

**After**:
```typescript
${data.timestamp.toLocaleString('en-US', {
  timeZone: 'America/New_York',
  dateStyle: 'medium',
  timeStyle: 'long'
})}
```

**Result**: All email timestamps now display in Eastern Time

## How It Works Now

### When a Real Call Comes In:
1. Call received by Retell AI
2. **2 minutes later**: Monitoring service polls Retell AI
3. Service detects new call ID
4. Email sent to `elitesquadp@protonmail.com`
5. Call ID added to "seen" list

### When a Real SMS Comes In:
1. SMS/chat received by Retell AI
2. **2 minutes later**: Monitoring service polls Retell AI
3. Service detects new chat ID
4. Email sent to `elitesquadp@protonmail.com`
5. Chat ID added to "seen" list

## Email Content

**Subject**: New Call Record / New SMS Message

**Body**:
- **Title**: "New Voice Call" or "New SMS Message"
- **Message**: "A new [type] has been received in your CareXPS CRM"
- **Time**: Eastern Standard Time format
- **Type**: New Call / New SMS
- **Source**: Hostinger SMTP (aibot@phaetonai.com)

## Configuration

### Email Settings (Already Configured)
- âœ… Email notifications enabled
- âœ… Recipient: `elitesquadp@protonmail.com`
- âœ… New Calls: Enabled
- âœ… New SMS: Enabled

### Monitoring Settings
- **Poll Interval**: 2 minutes
- **Max Delay**: Up to 2 minutes for email
- **Memory**: Tracks last 500 calls + 500 chats
- **Auto-start**: Yes (starts with app)

## Testing

### Test 1: Wait for Real Record
1. Wait for a real call or SMS to come in through Retell AI
2. Within 2-4 minutes, check email at `elitesquadp@protonmail.com`
3. Should receive notification email

### Test 2: Check Console Logs
Open browser console and look for:
```
ðŸ“Š Starting Retell AI monitoring for email notifications...
âœ… App - Retell AI monitoring service started
ðŸ“Š Checking for new Retell records...
ðŸ“Š Found X new calls, sending email notification
âœ… Email notification sent for new calls
```

### Test 3: Verify Monitoring Status
In browser console, run:
```javascript
// Check if monitoring is running
window.retellMonitoringService?.getStatus()

// Should return:
{
  isMonitoring: true,
  lastCheckTime: Date,
  pollInterval: 120000 // 2 minutes
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **2-minute delay**: Emails sent up to 2 minutes after record arrives (polling interval)
2. **Requires app open**: Monitoring only runs while app is open in browser
3. **No realtime**: Not instant like Supabase INSERT events (those are instant)

## Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Reduce polling interval** to 1 minute for faster notifications
2. **Add webhook support** for instant notifications (requires backend)
3. **Background service** to run even when app closed (requires service worker)

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/services/retellMonitoringService.ts` - NEW (196 lines)
2. âœ… `src/App.tsx` - Added monitoring service initialization
3. âœ… `src/services/emailNotificationService.ts` - Fixed timezone to Eastern Time

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED**

- Monitoring service created
- Integrated with App.tsx
- Timezone fixed to Eastern Time
- Ready for real-world testing

**Next time a call/SMS comes in through Retell AI, you should receive an email within 2-4 minutes!**
