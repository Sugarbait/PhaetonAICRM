### NOT Safe to Clean (Locked Down)

**Page Files - LOCKED (64 unused imports):**
- pages/SMSPage.tsx (19) - **ENTIRE FILE LOCKED**
- pages/CallsPage.tsx (16) - **ENTIRE FILE LOCKED**
- pages/DashboardPage.tsx (12) - **ENTIRE FILE LOCKED**
- pages/AuditDashboard.tsx (8) - **ENTIRE FILE LOCKED**
- pages/SecurityDashboard.tsx (6) - May be locked

**Component Files - LOCKED (11 unused imports):**
- components/settings/EnhancedProfileSettings.tsx (5) - **ENTIRE FILE LOCKED**
- components/security/TransmissionSecurityDashboard.tsx (6) - **ENTIRE FILE LOCKED**

**Partially Locked (27 unused imports):**

## 📋 Detailed Unused Import Examples

### App.tsx (10 unused imports)

Lines with unused imports:
```typescript
Line 3: 'supabase' is declared but its value is never read
Line 4: 'getCurrentTenantId' is declared but its value is never read
Line 5: 'ResourceType' is declared but its value is never read
Line 20: 'initializeSecureStorage' is declared but its value is never read
Line 29: 'secureUserDataService' is declared but its value is never read
Line 58: 'AlertTriangleIcon' is declared but its value is never read
Line 108: 'setMfaRequired' is declared but its value is never read
Line 108: 'handleMFASuccess' is declared but its value is never read
Line 240: 'getTimeRemainingFormatted' is declared but its value is never read
Line 394: 'setHipaaMode' is declared but its value is never read
```

**Note:** These lines are BEFORE the locked range (1236-1470), so they could potentially be cleaned with authorization.

### userSettingsService.ts (9 unused imports)

```typescript
Lines with unused variables/imports throughout the file
```

**Note:** This file was just enhanced in Phase 3 consolidation - safe to clean up unused imports.

## 💾 Estimated Cleanup Impact

### Conservative Estimate (Only Non-Locked Files)

**Files that can be safely cleaned:** ~30 files
**Unused imports that can be removed:** ~150 occurrences
**Lines of code reduction:** ~150-200 lines
**Risk level:** Low (only dead code removal, no functionality changes)

### Aggressive Estimate (Including Partially Locked Files)

**Additional files:** App.tsx, SettingsPage.tsx, userProfileService.ts
**Additional unused imports:** ~27 occurrences
**Additional lines reduction:** ~27-35 lines
**Risk level:** Medium (requires careful verification of locked ranges)

### Cannot Clean (Fully Locked Files)

**Files:** SMSPage, CallsPage, DashboardPage, AuditDashboard, EnhancedProfileSettings, etc.
**Unused imports:** ~75 occurrences
**Status:** Cannot be cleaned without breaking lockdown policy

---

## 🔧 Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Conservative Cleanup (Recommended)

**Target:** Service files, utility files, test files, examples
**Exclusions:** All locked files, all page files, all partially locked files
**Expected reduction:** ~150 lines
**Risk:** Very Low
**Authorization required:** Yes (comprehensive lockdown)

**Files to clean:**
1. Service files (12 files, ~92 unused imports)
2. Component files not locked (4 files, ~21 unused imports)
3. Utility files (5 files, ~15 unused imports)
4. Test files (4 files, ~16 unused imports)
5. Example files (1 file, ~6 unused imports)

**Total:** ~26 files, ~150 unused imports

### Option 2: Moderate Cleanup

**Target:** Option 1 + carefully selected partially locked files (App.tsx imports only)
**Exclusions:** All fully locked files
**Expected reduction:** ~160-170 lines
**Risk:** Low
**Authorization required:** Yes (comprehensive lockdown)

### Option 3: Full Cleanup (Not Recommended)

**Target:** All files including locked pages
**Risk:** HIGH - Violates lockdown policy
**Status:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED WITHOUT EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION**

---

## ⚠️ Lockdown Compliance

**Current Status:** ⏸️ **PAUSED - Awaiting Owner Authorization**

**Reason:** CLAUDE.md Section "COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM LOCKDOWN" states:

> **Prohibited Actions Without Owner Authorization:**
> - ❌ Modifying existing code or logic
> - ❌ Refactoring or restructuring code
> - ❌ Changing UI components or styling
> - ❌ Updating service layer logic

**To Proceed:** Owner must provide explicit authorization statement.

**Recommended Authorization Statement:**
> "I authorize removal of unused imports from the following non-locked service and utility files as the owner of Phaeton AI CRM. This cleanup is limited to dead code removal only with no functionality changes."

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Upon Authorization)

1. **Receive explicit owner authorization** for specific files or file categories
2. **Create backup branch** (git branch unused-imports-cleanup)
3. **Start with test files** (lowest risk)
4. **Clean service files** (moderate risk, not locked)
5. **Clean utility files** (low risk)
6. **Verify build** after each file or small batch
7. **Run full test suite** to ensure no functionality broken
8. **Create summary document** with before/after statistics
9. **Commit changes** with detailed commit message
10. **Mark task as complete** in todo list

---

## 📊 Impact on Overall Cleanup Goals

**Phase 1:** 304 files archived ✅
**Phase 2:** ~178 lines eliminated (credential loader) ✅
**Phase 3:** ~636 lines eliminated (user settings) ✅
**Phase 4:** ~150-200 lines to eliminate (unused imports) ⏸️ **PENDING AUTHORIZATION**

**Total potential reduction:** ~1,168-1,218 lines

**Analysis completed by:** Claude Code
**Status:** ⏸️ Awaiting owner authorization to proceed
**Recommendation:** Conservative cleanup of service/utility files only
